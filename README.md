The Employee Registration App allows users to manage employee records. Users can sign up and sign in to access the application, where they can add, view, edit, and delete employee information. The app provides fields for employee details such as name, email, status, and notes. It was built to facilitate easy management of employee data and enhance workflow efficiency in a corporate environment.

This app is built using Node.js and Express, with an interactive front-end rendered using EJS templates.

## Removing Git and Creating Your Own Repo
To remove the existing Git history and create your own repository:

1. Remove the existing .git folder:
  ```bash
  rm -rf .git
  ```
2. Initialize a new Git repository:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
3. Add all files to the new repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
4. Commit the changes
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ``` 
5. Create a new repository on GitHub (or any other platform) and follow the instructions to push your local repository.
  Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `<your-project-name>`
  Now link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook.git
  git push origin main
  ```
